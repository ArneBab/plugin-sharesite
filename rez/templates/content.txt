h2. Hello Freenet!

This is the first section of my site.

- I love Freenet.
- Fnord.

h3. Tip: Escape de-anonymization by style-analysis

- Write short sentences.
- Avoid special words (like "sophisticated" or "de-anonymization"). Except if all others use them, too.
- Copy the style of others. Even if it is different from the tips here.
- Have an "official" site in Freenet where you can talk about daily life. That content would always de-anonymize your anonymous sites. Do not adhere to these style rules there.
